    ///
    /// `got` counts the bytes actually placed in the caller's buffer, not
    /// the bytes that were available. [`FileDevice`] copies what it can
    /// and reports that count, so a read straddling EOF comes back with
    /// the readable prefix in `buf` and `got` equal to its length. The
    /// slice adapters in [`crate::slice`] refuse an out-of-range read
    /// before touching the parent, so they leave `buf` untouched and
    /// always report `got: 0` — including for a read that begins inside
    /// the slice and runs off its end, where a [`FileDevice`] of the same
    /// size would have reported a non-zero prefix. So **`got: 0` always
    /// means nothing was transferred, and does not on its own tell you
    /// whether anything was available**: from a [`FileDevice`] at EOF it
    /// happens to mean both, from a slice it means only the former.
    ///
    /// It is not the only error an over-read can produce, because most of
    /// this crate's devices do not own the bytes they serve:
    ///
    /// - [`crate::CachingDevice`], [`crate::ReadOnlyDevice`] and the
    ///   slice adapters forward an in-range read to their parent and
    ///   return the parent's error unchanged. Over a parent that reports
    ///   over-reads as [`Error::OutOfBounds`] — the `img-*` container
    ///   readers do — that is what the wrapper reports too.
    /// - [`crate::CallbackDevice`] surfaces a failing host callback as
    ///   [`Error::Io`]. The callback ABI is an errno-space code carrying
    ///   no byte count, so there is nothing to put in `got`.
    ///

    ReadOnly,
    /// A request refused before any transfer because its range is not
    /// wholly inside the device's declared size. Nothing was read or
    /// written; `size` is the device size, so the caller can clamp.
    ///
    /// **This crate constructs it in exactly one place:**
    /// [`crate::OwnedRwSlice`]'s `write_at`, for a write outside the
    /// slice. No read path here builds it, so matching it to catch an
    /// over-read of a [`FileDevice`], or a read past a slice's own end,
    /// is an arm that will never be taken — those report
    /// [`Error::ShortRead`] with `got: 0`.
    ///
    /// **It still reaches reads, from elsewhere.** A container that knows
    /// its virtual size before touching the backing store rejects an
    /// over-read up front rather than discovering EOF, and the
    /// `img-qcow2`, `img-vhd`, `img-vhdx` and `img-vmdk` readers all
    /// return `OutOfBounds` from `BlockRead::read_at` on that path. This
    /// crate's wrappers — [`crate::CachingDevice`],
    /// [`crate::ReadOnlyDevice`], the slice adapters — forward it
    /// unchanged from such a parent.
    ///
    /// So code reading through a `dyn BlockRead` of unknown provenance
    /// has to handle this as well as [`Error::ShortRead`] — and cannot
    /// treat the pair as exhaustive, because a
    /// [`crate::CallbackDevice`] reports its host's refusal as
    /// [`Error::Io`] however the host arrived at it. Only code that knows
    /// its device bottoms out in a [`FileDevice`] can rely on `ShortRead`
    /// alone.
    ///
    /// [`FileDevice`]: crate::FileDevice
