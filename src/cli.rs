//! The command-line plumbing every tool in the family shares: dispatch on
//! `argv[0]`, `--version`, `doctor`, the JSON output and the structured
//! error, the `--json`/`--text` switch, and the man pages and shell
//! completions packaging needs. Behind the `cli` cargo feature; the default
//! build, and the static library, contain none of it.
//!
//! IT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ANY FORMAT, and must not learn. A crate describes
//! its tools once, as a [`Family`] — the repository name, the crate and
//! version, the install hints, and one [`Tool`] per dotted name, each a
//! clap command and a function that runs it — and hands that to [`main`].
//! Everything here reads only that description.
//!
//! ONE COPY, NOT ONE PER CRATE. This module began as a directory each
//! tool carried by hand (`src/cli/common/`), and the copies drifted within
//! weeks: one `doctor` learnt to drain a long `--version` answer while the
//! others still stalled on it, one entry point learnt to align its help,
//! and some could write man pages while others could not. Do not copy it
//! back out; fix it here.
//!
//! THE CONTRACT IT CARRIES, so each crate fills it in rather than defining
//! its own:
//!
//! - **One binary, many names.** Invoked as a tool's dotted name
//!   (`mkfs.<fs>`, `fs.<fs>`, `img.<fmt>`), it is that tool. Invoked under
//!   any other name — the repository's (`rust-fs-<fs>`), or a renamed copy
//!   — the first argument names the tool, by its verb (`mkfs`) or its full
//!   name (`mkfs.<fs>`). That second form is the one nothing on PATH can
//!   shadow.
//! - **`--version`** prints `<tool> (<crate>) <version>` for every name,
//!   which is how `doctor` and the test suites tell our binary from
//!   another package's program of the same name.
//! - **Output.** A result is JSON on stdout by default, `--text` for
//!   people; file content is raw bytes and is never wrapped. A failure is
//!   `{"error": "...", "code": N}` on STDERR, and `N` is the exit status,
//!   so stdout carries a result or nothing — never half of one, and never
//!   an error a pipe would take for data.
//! - **Exit statuses**, outside a tool that has its own scheme (`fsck`'s
//!   0/1/4/8): 0 done, 1 failed, 2 the command line was wrong, 3 the verb
//!   exists but this crate cannot do it (not implemented, or the format is
//!   read-only). A script moved between formats fails loudly on 3 instead
//!   of meaning something else.
//! - **`<repo> doctor`** resolves every dotted name on PATH and says, per
//!   name, whether the program found is ours, and if not, what wins and
//!   how to fix it.
//! - **`<repo> generate names|man|completions`** (hidden) prints the dotted
//!   names to link, and writes the man pages and shell completions, from
//!   the same clap commands the tools parse with.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fs_core::cli::{self, CliError, Family, Json, Outcome, Tool};
//! use fs_core::cli::clap::{ArgMatches, Command};
//!
//! fn command() -> Command {
//!     Command::new("fs")

//!         .args(cli::format_args())
//!         .after_help("Examples:\n  fs.demo disk.img")
