        // `perf: reads are positioned, and no longer take a lock`
        // deliberately stopped doing. But releasing it used to mean N
        // threads missing the same block all read the device and all
        // inserted, so the cache held N copies of one block and had
        // evicted up to N-1 others to store bytes it already had.
        //
        // So a thread that is going to fetch says so first, under the
        // lock. A thread that finds someone else already fetching its
        // block waits for them and then looks again, rather than making
        // a second trip to the device for bytes already on their way.
        //
        // The loop is not a spin: `wait` blocks until a fetch finishes,
        // and re-checking from the top afterwards is what makes it
        // correct against a spurious wake, an invalidation that landed
        // in the meantime, and a fetch that failed and left nothing.
        //
        // A THREAD THAT IS ALREADY FETCHING SOMETHING NEVER WAITS,
        // WHOEVER OWNS THE BLOCK IT WANTS. WHICH IS WHY THE MARKER
        // CARRIES AN OWNER.
        //
        // A device whose `read_at` reads back through the cache that
        // wraps it re-enters this method while its own fetch is still
        // outstanding. The narrow case is that it asks for the very
        // block it is fetching, and waiting there is waiting for a
        // fetch this thread is holding up: a deadlock. That shape is
        // visible from the owner alone.
        //
        // THE GENERAL CASE IS NOT, and asking only "is this fetch
        // mine" cannot see it. Thread A fetches X and re-enters for Y;
        // thread B fetches Y and re-enters for X. Neither finds its own
        // id against the block it wants, so both wait -- each for a
        // fetch the other is holding up, on a condition variable only a
        // completed fetch can signal. Nothing completes. It is the same
        // deadlock one link longer, and there is no length at which
        // comparing the owner to the caller starts to notice.
        //
        // So the question is not "is this fetch mine" but "am I holding
        // one at all". A cycle needs every thread in it to be both
        // holding a fetch and waiting for another one; a thread holding
        // nothing cannot be waited on, so it cannot be in a cycle. A
        // thread therefore waits only when it holds nothing, and that
        // removes every cycle rather than the shortest one. It needs no
        // wait-for graph and no new state to do it -- only a wider
        // question asked of the list already being scanned.
        //
        // WHAT IT COSTS is a redundant device read in one narrow case:
        // a re-entrant thread that wants a block another thread is
        // fetching, where waiting would in fact have been safe. That is
        // the same trade the self case already made, and only a device
        // that re-enters can reach it. For every other caller nothing
        // changes at all, because a thread holds a fetch here only
        // while it is inside `read_at` on the device, and a device that
        // cannot call back in leaves this false on every ordinary miss.
        //
        // THE GUARD IS HERE BECAUSE OF WHAT A HANG COSTS, not because
        // re-entrancy is expected. It is not: no device in this crate
        // can do it today, since none holds a handle to what wraps it,
        // and stacked caches are unaffected because each has its own
        // lock and its own list. But `CachingDevice` accepts any
